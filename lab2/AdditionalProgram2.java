 * Write a program that creates a "triangular" two-dimensional array A of 10 rows. The first 
row has length 1, the second row has length 2, the third row has length 3, and so on. Then 
initialize the array using nested for loops so that the value of A[i][j] is i+j. Finally, print 
out the array in a nice triangular form
